# Learning Rust

Rust is a modern systems programming language that focuses on safety, speed, and concurrency. It was created by Mozilla Research and has gained significant popularity due to its unique features:

- Memory safety without garbage collection
- Thread safety without data races
- Zero-cost abstractions
- Modern tooling and package management
- Strong type system and ownership model

## Installation on Windows

### Prerequisites
1. Windows 10 or later
2. Administrator privileges
3. Internet connection

### Installation Steps

1. **Download the Rust Installer**
   - Visit the official Rust website: https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install
   - Download `rustup-init.exe` for Windows

2. **Run the Installer**
   - Double-click `rustup-init.exe`
   - Follow the on-screen instructions
   - Choose the default installation (recommended for beginners)

3. **Verify Installation**
   Open a new terminal and run:
   ```bash
   rustc --version
   cargo --version
   ```

4. **Install Visual Studio Build Tools** (Required for Windows)
   - Download Visual Studio Build Tools from: https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/visual-cpp-build-tools/
   - During installation, select "Desktop development with C++"
   - This provides the necessary C++ build tools for Rust
